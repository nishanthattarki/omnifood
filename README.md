# AthletesFuel - Performance Nutrition Platform

🏆 **AI-Powered Athletic Performance Meal Service**  
A modern and responsive frontend website for AthletesFuel - precision nutrition engineered for athletes.

This project emphasizes clean layout, modern UI, and great UX using CSS Flexbox and Grid wherever appropriate. The site includes:

A hero section with a compelling CTA

Two clean and responsive pricing cards

A showcase of diet options offered by the service

A step-by-step “How It Works” walkthrough

Testimonials and gallery sections to reinforce service trust

A strong call-to-action section followed by a clean footer

The site follows responsive design principles with breakpoints set based on actual layout needs rather than fixed device widths — ensuring great visuals across a wide range of screen sizes.
